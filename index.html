<p>
    If you've come along here, you're probably searching for an <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>elegant</strong> way
    to convert some <strong>JSON</strong> data into a so called
    <strong>Rich Model</strong> and/or vice versa.<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've found what you've been looking for! :)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>cherrypie.js</strong> is a rich-model populating model-factory which helps you to convert your incoming
    <code>JSON</code> object into a "rich" JS model object and vice versa with the help of a so called
    <code>model-description</code>, in no time!
</p>

<p>
    With <strong>cherrypie.js</strong> you're now able to get primitive <i>namespaced</i> object values as well as
    <i>computed properties</i> which depend on a number of values from the received JSON, and endless nested child models
    (via child model-description(s)) as well as reduce/desolate the rich model object back to the object which is
    expected at the backend.<br/>
    <br/>
<p>
    A short summary of what is possible with <strong>cherrypie.js</strong>:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Populate namespaced properties</strong><br/>
        Declare a <code>__namespace</code> for the whole model and/or a namespaced value to be populated - shorthand
        variables when it comes to prepare your data!<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Populate computed properties</strong><br>
        Each computed property (<code>function</code>) gets invoked with a prepared (namespace'd) origin and the
        <strong>cherrypie.js</strong> instance - fully flexible when it comes to prepare your data!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Populate nested child models</strong><br>
        Declare as many nested child models as you want within the <code>__children</code> property via a child <strong>model-description</strong>.
        Every nested child model-description is a full model-description on it's own - no limitations when it comes to
        prepare your data!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Desolate the rich model</strong><br>
        It is also possible to desolate the rich model into the JSON format you got by declaring all serializable data
        within the `__serializable` property, so you're able to convert it back and forth - no worries when it comes to
        prepare your data!
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
        Take a look at the <a href="getting-started">getting started</a> page to see how easy it is to give your data a
        proper setup.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>cherrypie.js</strong> micro library is currently available in version <code>0.5.0</code>
    and is finalizing in it's definitions so that it'll be production ready in a blink of an eye - looking
    forward to release version 1.0.0 in June / July 2014.
