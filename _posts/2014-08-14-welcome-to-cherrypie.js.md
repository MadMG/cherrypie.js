After a long time of trial and error (well, mostly error I must say) and a renaming of the project I came up with a 
site/blog for my `cherrypie.js` micro library. 

`cherrypie.js` is there to help you to form convenient and "rich" models from any form of JSON data you may think of. In 
my case I needed the library to convert data which was prepared for another application to fit my needs and to go my way
 of handling data within my application. If you want / have to work with such data, or if you just want to transform the
  received JSON data into something more useful, `cherrypie.js` is the thing you want!

If you want to contribute, please feel free to open issues / pull-requests @ [GitHub] - I'm looking forward to work with you :)


p.s.:
It was really a pain to get things done with `jekyll` and `gh-pages` all running on my Windows 7 machine, but it was 
worth it - perhaps I'll go and follow the line of people who are writing about their experiences when setting up 
`jekyll` but from the Windows side of view (as it seems that nobody uses these things on any other operating system than
 OSX) in my personal blog (if it will ever happen).
