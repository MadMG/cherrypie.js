## About `cherrypie.js`
`cherrypie.js` originally started out as the `json-molder` library, but after some research I thought it would be necessary
to rename the project as it was not an appropriate name for a powerful microlib which is capable of bringing your somewhat
messy `JSON` you got from the backend into a useful, logical form you can use in further programming.

`cherrypie.js` is licensed under MIT and I'll appreciate every raised issue and/or pull request being made to push the 
envelope further towards hardening and integration of new features (well, not so much "new" features as this should remain
a `microlib` and do what it can do best).

If you want to contribute to `cherrypie.js` please feel free to raise an [issue] or open up a [pull request] over at this
projects [github repository].

## About me

knowledge about programming, software structure & architecture as well as all things concerning JavaScript and Node.js.
